# 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

## 🤔 Why Not Microservices?

This project intentionally avoids a microservices architecture. Here's why:

### The Microservices Complexity Tax

While microservices can offer benefits in extremely large, distributed systems, they also introduce significant complexity:

- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services to deploy, monitor, and orchestrate
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Network latency, failure handling, and data consistency
- **Observability Overhead**: Distributed tracing, aggregated logging, and monitoring across services
- **Development Overhead**: More repositories/packages to manage, versioning challenges
- **Team Coordination**: Requires mature DevOps practices and larger teams
- **Operational Costs**: More infrastructure, more points of failure

### The Modular Monolith Advantage

For this application, a **modular monolithic architecture** provides a better balance:

#### ✅ Benefits

- **Simplicity**: Single deployment unit, easier to reason about
- **Performance**: No network overhead for internal communication
- **Development Speed**: Faster iteration, easier debugging
- **Lower Operational Cost**: Less infrastructure to manage
- **Team Efficiency**: Works well with small to medium teams
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries without distributed system complexity

#### 🧩 Still Modular

This monolith is **modular by design**:

- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Plugin-based backend architecture
- Feature-oriented folder structure
- Well-defined API contracts
- Independent testing capabilities

### When Should You Migrate?

You might need microservices when:

1. **Scale Requirements**: Different components need independent scaling
2. **Team Size**: Multiple teams working on different domains
3. **Technology Diversity**: Different services require different tech stacks
4. **Deployment Independence**: Need to deploy parts without affecting the whole
5. **Business Complexity**: Clear bounded contexts that naturally separate

### The Good News

**If you ever reach a point where migrating to microservices becomes necessary, you'll likely already have:**

- The technical maturity to understand the trade-offs
- The team size to manage distributed systems
- The business success to justify the complexity
- The understanding of your domain to split correctly
- The operational capabilities to run microservices

This architecture is designed to make that transition possible when (and if) it becomes necessary, without forcing premature complexity.

## 🎯 Current Architecture Principles

### 1. Monorepo with npm Workspaces

Frontend and backend coexist in a single repository but are managed as independent packages. This simplifies dependency management and scripting while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

**Benefits:**

- Atomic commits across frontend and backend
- Shared tooling and configurations
- Simplified version management
- Better refactoring support

### 2. Decoupled Architecture

The Angular client and Node.js server are completely independent applications communicating through a well-defined RESTful API.

**Benefits:**

- Each can be developed independently
- Technology changes are isolated
- Easy to test independently
- Clear API contracts

### 3. Layered Backend

The Node.js API follows a layered structure:

```
Routes → Controllers → Services → Models
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Better code organization
- Easier to reason about

### 4. Feature-Oriented Frontend

The Angular app is organized by features, not file types:

```
features/
  ├── image-generation/
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── image-generation.ts
  │   └── ...
  └── text-model/
      └── ...
```

**Benefits:**

- Related code stays together
- Easier to navigate
- Better modularity
- Clear feature boundaries

### 5. Plugin Architecture

The backend uses a plugin system for AI models:

```
plugins/
  ├── gemini-image-gen/
  ├── google-text-bison/
  └── google-vision-ocr/
```

**Benefits:**

- Easy to add new models
- Models are self-contained
- Clear contracts via interfaces
- No core changes needed for new features
