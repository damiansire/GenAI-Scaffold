# ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

> The last time I did this... I got 400 followers on GitHub and an endless number of emails from frustrated developers because their PMs / TLs / Coworkers were forcing them to follow some of my architecture/development practices or asking things like, "What should my developers do in this case?".

> So, I feel obligated to add this:

## 📌 Please Read This Before Using This Repository

**Do not force your developers to do things the way they are done in this repo, nor use it to tell them how to do things.**

This repository is meant to be a **reference**, a **learning resource**, and a **starting point** — not a rigid set of rules.

### Always Remember:

- **Ugly code that works** = you move fast, validate, and generate revenue.
- **Beautiful code without use** = long code review time, you feel proud, but the business dies.
- **Beautiful code that works** = rare, it usually comes after success, not before.

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

✅ **DO:**

- Use it as inspiration
- Learn from the patterns and practices
- Adapt what makes sense for your context
- Question everything and understand the "why"
- Start simple and evolve as needed

❌ **DON'T:**

- Force your team to replicate this exactly
- Use it as ammunition in code reviews
- Assume it's the "only right way"
- Apply patterns without understanding them

## 💡 Context Matters

Every project is different. What works here might not work for you. Consider:

- Your team size and experience
- Your business requirements
- Your timeline and constraints
- Your current technical debt
- Your users' needs

**The best architecture is the one that helps you ship value to your users.**

_Remember: This is a blueprint, not a prescription. Use your judgment, adapt to your needs, and most importantly — ship value._
